# web3_chess
The project is kept very simple as I had very less time to implement it. I also learned Solidity after midsems, which gave me less time to implement everything till perfection. I first wrote a solidity contract to create a game, join a game, and end a game, with few additional functions like Viewing the balance. Also this game involves putting a stake. So you can also or deposit funds. The front end is the least possible one I could make, credit goes to trying to host the project :(. I have tested the project locally on hardhat, but I was not able to test on a testnet. I tried a lot, but there were some errors I couldnt resolve yet.
